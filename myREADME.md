Welcome to Starfighters

Starfighters is a single player, turn based strategy game set in the depths of space. Take command as Admiral, your mission is to hunt down and destroy the opposing enemy fleet before the enemy can locate and destroy your own Starships.

The enemy Admiral has hidden their fleet within this star systems nebula cloud, and their precise location cannot be detected. but your scanners can detect instances of any shots fired that have hit or destroyed an enemey vessel or failed to hit their mark and sailed harmlessly into the endless void of space. But counter intellegence suggests the enemy can locate your fleet in the same manner, so time and precision is of the most importance to ensure victory and avoid your own destruction.

Over two tactical grids, and record your shots on the tactical grid maps to locate the enemy fleet and recieve damage reports of both your own and enemy vessels. The larger capital ships can sustain more damage before being destroyed however the smallest crafts within both fleets can be destroyed instantly by one direct hit.

Best of luck Admiral.


- How to Play

A brief History 

Starships is a single player game based on the classic pen and paper game of Battleships. In the original game the player is given two 10x10 grids. The first grid is used by for the placement of the players five Battleships of varying class and size, and to mark the opponents shots against the player's ships. The second grid is used to mark down the players shot against the enemy ships and to record the outcome of a players turn. Turns for both the player and their opponent will result in a shot either hitting or missing a ship or resulting in a Battleship being sunk. The size of the ship determines the required amount of hits before a Battleship is sunk.

The classes of naval ships used in the original game were:

- Carrier (5 grid spaces)
- Battleship (4 grid spaces)
- Cruiser (3 grid spaces)
- Submarine (3 grid spaces)
- Destroyer (2 grid spaces)

Due to different publications found of the game Battleships found around the word, ship names, ship and grid sizes can vary.

- More information on the game Battleships can be found at [link to wikipedia.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_game)

In my version Starfighters, the classic Naval game has been given a sci-fi twist, with a brief backstory and mission briefing to transport the player and game into the cosmos. 

A 5x5 grid size is being used for the players and the opponents ship placements. With the same basic rules of the game apply, find and destroy the entire enemy fleet, before they to destroy yours. Both sets of Starfighters are placed on the grids at random. 

- Features


- Game Design

The classic grid design from the game Battleships was used. This allows for precise placement of Player and Computer Starfighters, and Player shot placement.

A 5x5 grid size allows for a decent sized game board to accomodate single grid space sized Starfighters.
It would be my intention in a future update to add a 10x10 grid. As discussed further in the Future Improvement section.  

- Future Improvements:

The ability for the player to choose between the game standard 5x5 or a larger 10x10 grid size.

The ability for the player to set their own starfighter positions on their tactical grid.

Bigger Starships and Starfighters to be added, with an additional option of allowing the player choice of which Starships/Fighters to be used in their game. 

Bigger Starships and Starfighters would only be available to the player when playing on the 10x10 grid.

Difficulty option for the player to set the number of enemy ships to allow for increased or decreased game difficulty.

- Technologies Used

Starfighters was written using the Python programming language.
